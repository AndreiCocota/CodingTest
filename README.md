# Creating a histogram representing the number of posts created in each month of 2019

In this project I made a React web application that fetches a relevantly-sized list of posts from the mock GraphQL API and displays a histogram representing the number of posts created in each month of 2019.

I chose Apollo for GraphQL API and for the histogram I worked with VX - visx .

First, I studied the documentation a bit then I fetched the data from API and I got the specific data I needed. After this I created the histogram with the data previously obtained. This part challenged me because firstly I can't get the correct height of the graph. 

I was a pleasure for me to work on this coding test.
